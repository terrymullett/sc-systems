The files in folders starting with AKWF are the [Adventure Kid single-cycle waveforms](https://www.adventurekid.se/akrt/waveforms/adventure-kid-waveforms/) from Kristoffer Ekstrand, translated into SuperCollider wavetables using a variation of a method Alik Rustamoff [explained on his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9fmNHgUKzc&list=PLXCUkMwOEWQtB-leHHSexTizzcACdozp9&index=5). There are a lot of them. While it would be possible to load them all into memory at server boot and have them ready, that would only be useful if you use them in isolation. I like to select and put them in an order to morph between using VOsc, so for me it makes more sense to load the ones I want to morph through at the point I use them. Sketch [20211228-01](../sketches/20211228-01.scd) shows an example.

A [visual reference to the wave shapes and spectra](https://www.adventurekid.se/AKRTfiles/AKWF/view/waveforms_index.html) is on Kristoffer's blog. This is helpful for picking a candidate wavetables.
