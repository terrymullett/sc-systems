I had a big pile of wavetable files here, conversions of the Adventure Kid Wave Forms, but most of them weren't being used for anything yet and were just bloating up this repository. So I moved them to [another repository](https://github.com/terrymullett/AKWF-SuperCollider), if you happen to be looking for them, and only have here ones that are used by code in this repository.
