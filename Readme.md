# Music Systems in SuperCollider

This repository contains my fun with generative, aleoratic music systems using SuperCollider.

## Resources

Mads Kjeldgaard maintains an extensive list of resources at [Awesome SuperCollider](https://github.com/madskjeldgaard/awesome-supercollider), and I won't duplicate that effort. Below are just a handful that to me seem most useful to get going.
* [Download SuperColldier](https://supercollider.github.io/) for Windows, Mac or Linux. 
* [Download sc3-plugins](https://supercollider.github.io/sc3-plugins/) extensions.
* Eli Fieldsteel live-streams his two-semester basic-to-intermediate course on SuperCollider at University of Illinois [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPYzvS8A_rTZmJZjUtMG6GJ2QkLUEaY4Q) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPYzvS8A_rTbTAn-ZExGuVFZgVMwYi1kJ).
* Eli's topic-oriented tutorial series [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPYzvS8A_rTaNDweXe6PX4CXSGq4iEWYC). 
* H. James Harkins' [Practical Guide to Streams, Patterns and Events](http://doc.sccode.org/Tutorials/A-Practical-Guide/PG_01_Introduction.html) (also found in SuperCollider's help).
* The [JITLib tutorials](http://doc.sccode.org/Overviews/JITLib.html) (in the help as well).
* Alik Rustamoff's advanced video series [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXCUkMwOEWQtB-leHHSexTizzcACdozp9).

## Dependencies and Caveats

The code here uses sc3-plugins. If I use other extensions in a piece I'll raise an alert in the piece's Readme.md.  

In the *sketches* folder I experiment, and anything goes there. Some of it might be broken or stupid.
