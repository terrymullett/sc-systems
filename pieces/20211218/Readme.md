# Generative strategy
Notes are picked from a preselected four, making a short figure of one to four notes in one of four octaves, with the middle octaves favored. That figure is repeated, and on each repeat several things change:
* The volume goes down
* The low-pass filter cutoff becomes lower
* The filter Q becomes lower
* The slight chorusing become a little more pronounced

When the volume goes down to less than 60db, the figure stops repeating. The interval between repeats is a multiple of the figure's duration.

Meanwhile, new figures are generated and follow the same pattern of change, overlapping the previous material as that fades away. The interval at which to generate a new figure is a larger multiple of the previous figure's duration.

A sample recorded from this generator is here:
