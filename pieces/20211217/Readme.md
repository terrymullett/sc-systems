# Generative strategy
Seven notes from a chord played in separate loops that have different loop times so that their time relationships evolve. Sometimes notes relate to one another as arpeggiated, sometimes as chords.

This is my SuperCollider interpretation of [Tero Parviainen's Javascript/WebAudio interpretation](https://teropa.info/blog/2016/07/28/javascript-systems-music.html) of Brain Eno's  *Music For Airports*, track 2. 

The UI is a Play/Stop button. When Play is pressed, the button is locked at Starting until all 7 loops are started, before changing to Stop. When Stop is pressed, the button is locked at Stopping while the system cleans up resources.
